										<h2 class="major">The Story</h2>
										<p>
										In Jennifer Hidgon's program notes, she explained, "Cathedrals represent a place of
										beginnings, endings, solitude, fellowship, contemplation, knowledge and growth." Although this piece takes on a slightly softer tune than some of the other pieces, this piece goes through a story with a beginning and an ending. It contains all of the mention emotions, and more. The song paints a picture of a person who simply decides to visit a blue cathedral. Within that cathedral, the person experiences a spiritual and mental journey; their mind flies amongst the clouds, and their imagination reaches new heights. 
	     								</p>

	     								<p>
	     								Within 13 minutes and a single movement, Jennifer is able to compose a piece that paints this lovely image. The piece is performed by flutes, piano, strings, clarinets, and the occasional horns, trumpets, and trombones. The instruments enter the song at strategic times to tell the story. 
	     								</p>

	     								<p>Jennifer's piece was dedicated to her brother, who had recently passed away. By composing this piece, Jennifer attempts to reach her brother and honor his passing (with the religious connotation of the cathedral). As the song explores the life of the person who walks into the cathedral, Jennifer is able to explore the path of her brother's life as he enters the cathedral, and slowly descends into the heavens. </p>
	     								<h2 class="major">Walkthrough of the Piece</h2>
	     								<p>
	     									The songs begins with the light introduction of chimes. The harp then accompaies the chimes. The melody lightly picks up as more strings and woodwind instruments are introduced. Around 1:10, the strings dominate the melody, with the woodwinds providing the accompaniment. At this time, the piece has a light, colorful mood. It is kept in piano, and descending triads than begin and end in C Major occur, which represents the walking of steps through the cathedral. The various solo insruments represent the introduction of new observations of the cathedral. 
	     								</p>

	     								<p>The light melody continues, and a colorful picture is painted; the person inside the cathedral is observing the architecture and style of the cathedral. At 2:30, the harp crescendoes a bit, and plays in a legato manner. Around 2:46, the instruments begin echoing each other. They layer their sounds on top of each other in a gradual crescendo. This results in the scforzando entrance of the brass instruments at 3:11. The chimes echo in a distant, creating a disoriented sound (a violent contrast from the brass instruments). This represents the person begin their ascent into heaven, and the memories of the past begin. Some of the chords play by the chimes sound sporatic, creating a mixed atmosphere. </p>

	     								<p>The music suddenly goes piano again around 4:30. The chimes gently echo in, but the melody is once again dominated by the woodwinds and strings. The instruments play at a minor key, creating confusion. Chimes play in an staccato motion. At 6:25, the violins contribute and the tempo becomes playful and joyful. The drums interject, and this represents the person's acceptance of heaven and acceptance of their future. At 7:28, the tone changes completely and the instruments play in a marching tone. As the rest of the instruments cresencedo, the chime interjects scales. At 8:20, the trumpets dominate, building up to a huge event. They use repetition, even when the rest of the instruments enter again. At 9:00, the song reaches its climax; the instruments play boldly, and the descent into heaven has finished. <p>

	     								<p>At 9:45, the song begins the same gentle melody that was introduced at the beginning of the piece. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Connection to other pieces</h2>
										<p>By giving such a detailed program note that highlights Jennifer's feelings, her piece envokes many of the same feelings as the program music of the romantic period. "Blue Cathedral" conveys a huge connection to the outside world through the usage of instruments and no vocalists. As a piece with similar characteristics of program music, "Blue Cathedral" is able to convery emotion, feelings, and experiences with the guidance of the composer. The accompanying program note guides the listener to pay attention to certain parts.</p>

										<p>One piece that contains many similarities to "Blue Cathedral" is Robert Schumann's "Carnaval". Although his composition is not one piece that tells a story from beginning to end, his composition is made up of multiple pieces that each capture a different mood. The different moods in "Carnaval" draws parallels to the journey of the soul and the soul's reflection of life. However, while a lot of information is given about the character pieces in "Carnaval", there are also </p>
