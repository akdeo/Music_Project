										<h2 class="major">The Story</h2>
										<p>
										In Jennifer Hidgon's program notes, she explained, "Cathedrals represent a place of
										beginnings, endings, solitude, fellowship, contemplation, knowledge and growth." Although this piece takes on a slightly softer tune than the other given pieces, this piece tells a story with a beginning and an ending. It contains all of the mention emotions, along with desire and hope. The song paints a picture of a person who simply decides to visit a blue cathedral. Within that cathedral, the person experiences a spiritual and mental journey; their mind flies amongst the clouds, and their imagination reaches new heights. 
	     								</p>

	     								<p>
	     								Within 13 minutes and a single movement, Jennifer is able to compose a piece that paints this lovely image. The piece is performed by flutes, piano, strings, clarinets, and the occasional horns, trumpets, and trombones. The instruments enter the song at strategic times to tell the story. 
	     								</p>

	     								<p>Jennifer's piece was dedicated to her brother, who had recently passed away. By composing this piece, Jennifer attempts to reach her brother and honor his passing (with the religious connotation of the cathedral). As the song explores the life of the person who walks into the cathedral, Jennifer is able to explore the path of her brother's life as he enters the cathedral, and slowly descends into the heavens. </p>
	     								<h2 class="major">Walkthrough of the Piece</h2>
	     								<p>
	     									The song begins with the light introduction of chimes, accompanied by the harp. The melody lightly picks up as more strings and woodwind instruments are introduced. Around 1:10, the strings dominate the melody, with the woodwinds providing the accompaniment. At this time, the piece has a light, colorful mood. It is kept in piano, and descending triads that begin and end in C Major occur, which represents the walking of steps through the cathedral. The various solo insruments represent the introduction of new observations of the cathedral. 
	     								</p>

	     								<p>The light melody continues, and a colorful picture is painted; the person inside the cathedral is observing the architecture and style of the cathedral. At 2:30, the harp crescendoes a bit, and plays in a legato manner. Around 2:46, the instruments begin echoing each other. They layer their sounds on top of each other in a gradual crescendo. This results in the scforzando entrance of the brass instruments at 3:11. The chimes echo in a distantance, creating a disoriented sound (a violent contrast from the brass instruments). This represents the person beginning their ascent into heaven, and the memories of the past begin. Some chords played by the chimes sound sporatic, creating a mixed atmosphere. </p>

	     								<p>The music suddenly goes piano again around 4:30. The chimes gently echo in, but the melody is once again dominated by the woodwinds and strings. The instruments play at a minor key, creating confusion. Chimes play in an staccato motion. At 6:25, the violins contribute and the tempo becomes playful and joyful. The drums interject, and this represents the person's acceptance of heaven and acceptance of their future. At 7:28, the tone changes completely and the instruments play in a marching tone. As the rest of the instruments cresencedo, the chime interjects scales. At 8:20, the trumpets dominate, building up to a huge event. They use repetition, even when the rest of the instruments enter again. At 9:00, the song reaches its climax; the instruments play boldly, and the descent into heaven has finished. <p>

	     								<p>At 9:45, the song begins the same gentle melody that was introduced at the beginning of the piece. The sweet melody begins, and the song reaches a gradual close. This is the acceptance of heaven, and the acceptance of the person's passing. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Connection to other pieces</h2>
										<p>By giving such a detailed program note that highlights Jennifer's feelings, her piece envokes many of the same feelings as the program music of the romantic period. "Blue Cathedral" conveys a huge connection to the outside world through the usage of instruments and no vocalists. As a piece with similar characteristics of program music, "Blue Cathedral" is able to convery emotion, feelings, and experiences with the guidance of the composer. The accompanying program note guides the listener to pay attention to certain parts.</p>

										<p>One piece that contains many similarities to "Blue Cathedral" is Robert Schumann's "Carnaval". Although his composition is not one piece that tells a story from beginning to end, his composition is made up of multiple pieces that each capture a different mood. The different moods in "Carnaval" draws parallels to the journey of the soul and the soul's reflection of life. However, while a lot of information is given about the character pieces in "Carnaval", there is still room left for interpretation. </p>

											<h2 class="major">My Interpretation</h2>

											<p>While my interpretation of the piece contains many similarities to Jennifer's program note, I believe that the blue cathedral can also be represented in other ways. Instead of connecting the piece to death and and ascending into heaven, I believe the piece could also be representing an admiration of the cathedral itself, and how it relates back to that person and their past memories. I envision a person walking alone in that cathedral, reflecting on the architecture and how they are reminded of their struggles. At the end of the piece, I believe that person feels acceptance of their inner turmoil, and they are able to mentally move on. While walking through the cathedral, the changes in melody represents their inner struggle and coming to terms with the past. The cathedral shines a new light for them, similar to the light shining through the stain-glassed windows.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Brass Instruments</h3>
											<p>Whenever the brass instruments are introduced, they represent a transition in the piece. The mood changes, and the brass instruments repeats similar chords through that part of the piecce. </p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Strings and Woodwinds</h3>
											<p>The strings and woodwinds are the central instrumental groups in this piece. They carry the melody, and play central roles in the introduction and conclusion.</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Piano</h3>
											<p>In many of the pieces we have studied in this class, the piano has played a dominating role. However, the piano is subtle in this piece, and plays a role equal to the rest of the instruments. This is a representation of how the importance of piano in the orchestra has developed over time. </p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Harp</h3>
											<p>The harps provide a mystical, colorful image to this piece. They paint a unique picture, which differentiates this piece from other orchestral pieces.</p>
