										<p>
										In Jennifer Hidgon's program notes, she explained, "Cathedrals represent a place of
										beginnings, endings, solitude, fellowship, contemplation, knowledge and growth." Although this piece takes on a slightly softer tune than some of the other pieces, this piece goes through a story with a beginning and an ending. It contains all of the mention emotions, and more. The song paints a picture of a person who simply decides to visit a blue cathedral. Within that cathedral, the person experiences a spiritual and mental journey; their mind flies amongst the clouds, and their imagination reaches new heights. 
	     								</p>

	     								<p>
	     								Within 13 minutes and a single movement, Jennifer is able to compose a piece that paints this lovely image. The piece is performed by flutes, piano, strings, clarinets, and the occasional horns, trumpets, and trombones. The instruments enter the song at strategic times to tell the story. 
	     								</p>

	     								<p>Jennifer's piece was dedicated to her brother, who had recently passed away. By composing this piece, Jennifer attempts to reach her brother and honor his passing (with the religious connotation of the cathedral). As the song explores the life of the person who walks into the cathedral, Jennifer is able to explore the path of her brother's life as he enters the cathedral, and slowly descends into the heavens. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Connection to other pieces</h2>
										<p>By giving such a detailed program note that highlights Jennifer's feelings, her piece envokes many of the same feelings as the program music of the romantic period. "Blue Cathedral" conveys a huge connection to the outside world through the usage of instruments and no vocalists. As a piece with similar characteristics of program music, "Blue Cathedral" is able to convery emotion, feelings, and experiences with the guidance of the composer. The accompanying program note guides the listener to pay attention to certain parts.</p>

										<p>One piece that contains many similarities to "Blue Cathedral" is Robert Schumann's "Carnaval". Although his composition is not one piece that tells a story from beginning to end, his composition is made up of multiple pieces that each capture a different mood. The different moods in "Carnaval" draws parallels to the journey of the soul and the soul's reflection of life. However, while a lot of information is given about the character pieces in "Carnaval", there are also </p>
